Chroma-Lights
=============

Chroma lights is a frame work for running annimations for led lights over OSC.

Setup
-----
#### 1. Install virtualenv (skip if you have it already)
```bash
sudo easy_install virtualenv
```

#### 2. Create your virtualenv for chroma-scripts
```bash
virtualenv env # or replace 'env' with whatever folder  you want your environment in
```

#### 3. Activate the environment
```bash
source env/bin/activate
```

#### 4. Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r dependencies.txt
```

Windows Setup
-----
###### 0. Get and burn a Debian ISO from http://www.debian.org/CD/

###### 1. Wipe your hard drive and install Debian

###### 2. Follow the Setup instructions above

Running
-------
You'll want to activate your virtualenv if it's not already. In your chrome-scripts folder (after having set everything up above before), `source env/bin/activate`.
In order to run the animations locally, we provide a lights emulator written in Processing.

To run the light emulator: `$ emulator/lights_emulator`

To run an animation: `$ ./run.py [animation name]`


Contributing
------------
To contribute add a new folder in the animation directory. 
This folder should be have a unique name for the animation.
The folder must contain the following two files:

main.py:

```python
import sys
sys.path.append("./osc")
from oscapi import ColorsOut
...
```

manifest.json:

```json
{
	"name":"Random Colors",
	"description":"Random colors on 3 second intervals",
	"creator":"RJ and Reed"
}
```

Each light recieves an input that is a tuple (r,g,b) where each of r, g, b can be 0-1023.

Construct an array of tuples and send them to the OSC server with 

```python
pix = [(1023.0,0.0,0.0)]*24
out = ColorsOut()
out.write(pix)
```

To add simple effects, such as automatic fade-in and fade-out of pixels, use the animations library in place of ColorsOut

```python
from animations import FadeAnimation
pix = [(1023.0,0.0,0.0)]*24
out = FadeAnimation()
out.FADEINRATE = 2.0 #optional
out.FADEOUTRATE = 8.0 #optional, makes things 'trail off'
out.start()
out.write(pix)
```

Tips and Tricks
---------------

Chroma is bright, and can easily be the predominant lighting in the room.  Fast blinking of the lights can be intense, so be considerate.

* Avoid instantaneous changes in both intensity and color
* Use the provided animation framework to transition between colors
